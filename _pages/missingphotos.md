# **Missing photos**

##### How photo storage works in Lens Buddy:

Lens Buddy can store photos either locally inside the app (default) or in the camera roll (Photos app). This can be set in `Settings -> Capture content to..` and only applies to new photos. Please note that even when you set to store in the camera roll the photos will still show up in Lens Buddy even though they are not stored in the app. When you hit `Save` in Lens Buddy that photo will be copied to the camera roll and will be stored both in the app and in the camera roll.

##### If you deleted a photo that is stored locally inside the app:

If you delete a photo from the Lens Buddy gallery the app stores it for 7 days and those can be recovered from `recently deleted`. Recently deleted is at the bottom of the gallery list.
After the 7 days pass the file is physically removed from the device and from that point it's not possible to recover it.

##### If you deleted a photo that is stored in the camera roll:

If you delete a photo that is stored in the camera roll (by using either the Photos app or Lens Buddy) it will be moved to the Recently Deleted in the Photos app (and NOT the `recently deleted` in Lens Buddy).  At this point it will disappear from Lens Buddy but will still be available in the Recently Deleted in the Photos app for some time. (Usually around 30 days.)

##### If you deleted the app:

If you deleted the app but saved photos to the camera roll (either by capturing photos directly to the camera roll or have exported from the app later) those should be available.
If you deleted the app but photos were only saved in the app then it's unfortunately not possible to recover them.

##### If you lost your device or switched to a new device:

If a photo was saved in the camera roll (either by capturing there directly or by having exported from Lens Buddy) and you have iCloud backup enabled it should be available in the Photos app.
If you only had the photos in Lens Buddy then unfortunately they can’t be recovered since they were stored locally on the device.

If you have an iCloud backup of your phone then when you restore on a new phone from the iCloud backup (`restore from iCloud backup`) there *might* be some photos still available eventually in the app through the `Lost and Found` menu. However, this is not supported and is not guaranteed to have any success because it depends on many variables. (eg. whether iCloud backup was turned on or not on the old device, if the old device had a chance to do a backup, network circumstances etc.)
