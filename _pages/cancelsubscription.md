# **Canceling a subscription**

Thank you for considering supporting Lens Buddy! We constantly strive to improve it and make it the best app for photography listening to user feedback. However we understand that you might have other priorities. Getting a refund is a 2 step process, where you need to stop the subscription first and once it's done you'll need to request a refund from Apple.

##### Here's how you can stop an active subscription:

1. Open the Settings app on your iOS device.
2. Tap on your name at the top of the screen. (Scroll up if you don’t see it right away)
3. Tap on "Subscriptions." (If you don't see "Subscriptions," tap on "iTunes & App Store" first, then tap on your Apple ID, and finally tap on "View Apple ID." You might need to sign in or use Touch ID or Face ID).
4. You'll see a list of your active subscriptions. Tap on the subscription you want to cancel.
5. Tap "Cancel Subscription" at the bottom of the screen.
6. Follow the prompts to confirm your cancellation.

Please note that canceling a subscription will not refund any previous subscription charges, and you'll still have access to the subscription content until the current subscription period ends.

##### Requesting a refund:

We’d love to help more but as an app developer we don’t have control over refunds as payments for subscriptions are handled by Apple.

Once you stopped the subscription please request for a refund on this site:
